Credit card applications\n","<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.

A question to ask is: <em>are the features that affect the credit card approval decision process correlated with each other?</em> Although we can measure correlation, that is outside the scope of this notebook, so we'll rely on our intuition that they indeed are correlated for now. Because of this correlation, we'll take advantage of the fact that generalized linear models perform well in these cases. Let's start our machine learning modeling with a Logistic Regression model (a generalized linear model).</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"35183153-ab04-42a2-bb9a-82d9f7fa5e0d","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"59"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["LogisticRegression(C=1.0, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,\n","          intercept_scaling=1, max_iter=100, multi_class='ovr', n_jobs=1,\n","          penalty='l2', random_state=None, solver='liblinear', tol=0.0001,\n","          verbose=0, warm_start=False)"]},"execution_count":216,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","\n","# Instantiate a LogisticRegression classifier with default parameter values\n","logreg = LogisticRegression()\n","\n","# Fit logreg to the train set\n","logreg.fit(rescaledX_train, y_train)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0dcde69a-068f-4080-8118-6199dfd24af2","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"66"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 10.
